WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT PRODUCTION READY!

# The biggest Raspberry Pi Hat ever made ...
A Latching Relay PCB with a socket for a Raspberry Pi.

All components are through-hole for field maintenance on moving platforms more secure attachment for vibration and G loads.
All relays can be controlled from either the RPi or using analog control signals via RJ45/CAT5/6 connectors/cables.
All relays are latching dual coil with individual control circuits.
All analog input channels have pulse generators for the relays to protect them from overheating.

Built-in high efficiency 5v/12 PSU to power the RPi and all logic components and supply current for analog control.

8x 60A 250V AC individual unprotected circuits
8x 16A 250V AC shared bus protected circuits
24x 16A 12V DC shared bus protected circuits

32x 12V 500mA DC Logic/Relay breakout via RJ45

The board is desined in two parts, the main board is designed for 3.4mm PCBs with 6oz copper, the 60A daughter board is designed for 3.4mm+ 13oz copper.

Protection is provided using thermal circuit breakers, the permitted amperage can be changed by switching out breakers, no breakers are provided for the 60A circuits.
