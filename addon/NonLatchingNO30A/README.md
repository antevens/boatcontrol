Addon board for Boatcontrol 32.

The Boatcontrol 32 is a smart distribution panel and electrical system for on/off-grid and hybrid backup power systems that need to handle 12-24v DC 110-115v AC and 200-250V AC systems.
A perfect companion to a SMA Sunny Island or Sunny Boy Storage, Fronius or other battery inverters.

It's a one stop PCB that allows a Raspberry Pi (RPi) or Nvidia Jetson to control your entire electrical system while retaining full analog control from external switches and allowing manual override onboard in case of emergencies.
This addon board adds 16 x 30A AC/DC relays.

Note that the relays are paired for manual override. When operating relayes in
emergency mode only one out of a pair can be operated at a time.
